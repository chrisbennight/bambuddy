"""Who sees which library folder, and who may write into it (#3201).

A folder has an owner (``created_by_id``, the user who made it) and can be
marked ``shared`` by an admin. A user with ``library:read_all`` (or any
caller when auth is off) sees every folder. An API key is passed in as its
``ApiKeyActor`` and treated as its owner within its scopes. A user with only
``library:read_own`` sees:

  - folders they own,
  - shared folders,
  - folders holding one of their own files,
  - and the parents needed to reach any of those, for navigation only.

They may write into (upload, extract, move files, create subfolders in)
their own folders and shared ones, plus the root. Everything else is hidden:
a folder they can't see answers 404, exactly like another user's file.

A folder made without a user (auth off, a key without an owner) is created shared, so
switching auth on later doesn't hide it. Folders from before #3201 got an
owner or the shared flag from the upgrade backfill in ``core/database.py``.
